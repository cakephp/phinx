Installation
============

Phinx should be installed using Composer. Composer is a tool for dependency
management in PHP. Please visit the `Composer <http://getcomposer.org/>`_ 
website for more information.

.. note::

    Phinx requires at least PHP 5.3.2 (or later).

To install Phinx simply add it as a dependency to your project's 
``composer.json`` file:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "require": {
            "robmorgan/phinx": "*"
        }
    }

Then run Composer:

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar install --no-dev

Create a folder in your project directory called "migrations" with adequate permissions,
it is where your migration files will be located and should be writable.

Phinx can now be executed from within your project:

.. code-block:: bash

    php vendor/bin/phinx init
